    - Creating new react project :
    
      1. Entering where you want to make a project : `react-projects-directory`
      
          ```
          cd react-projects-directory
          ```
      2. Typing the name you want to create : `your-project-name`

          npx create-react-app your-project-name
          ```

#  ‚úè Notes
- React Projects Use A `Build Process`

  > React projects require a build process that transforms your code

  1. Raw, unprocessed React code won't execute in the browser -> `JSX` is not a default JavaScript feature
  
  2. In addition, the code would `not be optimized` for production (e.g., not minified)

- React is all about `Components`
  1. Reusability

  2. Separation of Concerns

- `Props` are the `attributes` of your "custom HTML elements" (Components)

- `Composition`
  1. Whenever combine components, using composition
  
  2. `props.children` (which is the context between the opening and closing tags) allows you to create a wrapper component
 
- Cleaner HTML Code
  - `Fragmet`:
    1. To avoid `<div>` soup
    
    2. React.Fragment
    
    3. `<Fragmet> ... </Fragment>`
  
  - `Portal`:
    1. Render component to other section
  
    2. `ReactDOM.createPortal(which component..., where to...);`
  
  - `Reference`:
    1. For Read only (not for changing -> if changing then `useState()`)

    2. An object which always has `current` prop

    3. Reat.userRef

    4. `const variableName = useRef(defaultValue);`

- `useEffect()` hook
  1. `useEffect(() => {}, [])`: first param is `function` and second param is `dependency array`
  
  2. Runs only if dependency changes
  
  3. Rus "AFTER" every component evaluation

- useState() vs. useReducer()
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      <strong>
        useState()
      </strong>
    </th>
    <th>
      <strong>
        useReducer()
      </strong>
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      The main state management "tool"
    </th>
    <th>
      Greate if you need "more power"
    </th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>
      Greate for independent pieces of state/data
    </th>
    <th>
      Should be considered if you have related pieces of state/data
    </th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>
      Greate if state updates are easy and limited to a few kinds of updates
    </th>
    <th>
      Can be helpful if you have more complex state updates
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>
